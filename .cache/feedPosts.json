At least the unavailable tracks\nshould be shown last, as frequently (at least in Canada) you will see that an album is unavailable only to see a\ndifferent copy of the album available on the second or third page.</li>\n<li>Genre is not an available way to search music, since this data is clearly available in the AllMusic it should be integrated into the service (the more that rdio makes music discoverable the better).  Especially in the Top Charts, which for me is a completely pointless endevour without genre.</li>\n<li>While playing on the desktop the music sometimes cuts out (or more often at the end of a track the next track is not played).   I am sure that this is something that they are working on, but it is annoying to say the least.</li>\n<li>The collections feature seems almost useless, it makes things a little easier to find in the mobile app (slightly faster than searching) but in the desktop client the Collection takes so long to load it is almost always faster just to search.  More should be done with the collection in being able to improve recommendations and the like, but for now it seems like a big waste of time to your Match Your Collection.  Adding artists to your collection also seems like you are just adding things to the void, and what you really should do is add to a playlist to check out later (which I currently do).  Maybe if I paired my collection down, it would be better but for now it is a frustrating feature.</li>\n<li>The Desktop Air Client seems only to be another annoyance.  It is the only way to Match your collection (however, as I have stated above that seems to serve little purpose), but beyond that it serves no purpose other than something that seems to want to update the Air Runtime and update itself every time I start (with no apparent features added).  It isn't even smart enough to stay logged in, and you must have a browser window with RDIO open when it starts up or it won't be logged in.  I really fail to see the purpose the application, since you really need to have a browser window open to use RDIO anyway, and the Desktop Application seems to add nothing to the experience.</li>\n<li>Recommendations (and almost all notices) are sent via email (which tend to end up in Spam filters no matter how often I mark them as not spam), which seems a contrary way to develop a social network, adding a simple messaging center to the interface would be simple and make a lot of sense.

Unless you are a Windows Phone developer most of these are going to come\nwith pretty steep learning curves, just looking at the boiler-plate code emitted when creating a Metro Html/Javascript made my head spin and reminded\nme of the old Embrace/Extend/Eliminate Microsoft of the past (yes lets create Html5 applications that only run in the Metro WindowsRT world, please!).</p>\n<p>Even if you are just converting a Windows Phone 7 application to Metro you are going to have to develop a second User Interface(or three if you create a\nnew UI for Desktop sized screens as well as tablet screens) as something designed for a 4&quot; phone screen isn't going to scale well for 11&quot; touchpad\nscreen and certainly isn't going to look good on a 24&quot; monitor.

They responded slowly (like the responded <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/05/0526bill-gates-internet-memo/\">slowly to the internet in 1995</a>), but by the time they got around to deciding what to do\nthey have decided to go all in.  Make their tablet (and now their smartphone) all run the same operating system as the one thing they can be\nassured that a ton of us will run, the desktop.</p>\n<p>However, they also realized that they had to radically change the underlying way that windows operated, as people would not accept a tablet\nand phone that got viruses the way that windows does.  So they created WindowsRT, a sandboxed version of windows that won't allow easy installation\nof programs except through the Microsoft store (this will help stop malicious applications from being installed by social engineering).  It also\nlimits what a programmer can do except with permissions from the user.  And they created a browser that will not allow the installation of\nplugins (plugins being the major source of browser exploits in the past couple of years).  They relented to allowing flash, but they will only\nrun white-listed flash applications, which means that if your website needs to run flash you will have to apply to get on the Microsoft whitelist for flash.\nProbably the best way to handle flash, however it will probably be confusing for the inexperienced user why their favorite flash game\nwebsite works when they got their from the desktop and why it doesn't when the got their from the Metro UI).</p>\n<p>Of course if you use the Desktop you can still get viruses and malware to your hearts content, but Microsoft if doing everything\nthey can to force you into the Metro experience.  The start button became a start screen thus if you want to start an application you will\nusually be forced back to the Metro screen.  Microsoft is hoping that you like it there, and that developers will see that they can make lots of\nmoney writing applications there.  And once they have people in the Metro mindset, the tablet and the phone will be there waiting for them.  And\napplications written for the Metro desktop will already run on the Surface tablet, and are apparently easy to convert to the new Windows Phone 8.\nIt sounds like a good plan, unless people start hating the Metro UI and how it has been artificially forced on you by Microsoft.  And unfortunately from my\nusage so far, the whole Metro UI suffers from feeling like a 1 point 0 release, and everyone knows that Microsoft never gets things right until version 3.</p>\n<p>Personally I think that this is going to make Windows 7 the next Windows XP and Windows 8 the next Vista.   I think that unless Microsoft charges\nalmost nothing for WindowsRT licences that Windows tablets will go nowhere, and that the Windows Phone is already dead.  With the phone it took them\nfar too long to get to be on par with the competition and when the competing operating system is as good or better and free, how do you convince\npartners to use your operating system (other than by giving them a ton of money to do so, like they did with Nokia).</p>\n<p>They missed the boat on tablets as well, with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eETKiAvGmc8\">Ballmer claiming that Windows 7 was fine for tablets</a>.  Because the turn around\nfor a Windows operating system is 3 years (now it's three years, with Vista it was 6), they are unable to adjust and add things like functionality\nrequired for a tablet.  Of course Microsoft had had tablets for years, but they never worked and always fell short of the mark.  When Apple released the\nfirst tablet that made sense, everyone was grasping trying to come up with a response.  For Microsoft it was trying to have their hardware partners shovel\nWindows 7 on a tablet, for Google it was Honeycomb.   But after a year and a half later there was a good tablet operating system in Ice Cream Sandwich.\nWindows 8 will be released two and a half years after the iPad and it will be playing catch up as badly as the first Windows Phone was playing catch up to the iPhone.\nAnd since Microsoft only releases a new operating system every 3 years, unless they change their pattern, it will be almost impossible for it to catch up.</p>\n<p>Showing that they don't trust their hardware partners, and throwing them under the bus by releasing the surface may provide a decent hardware experience\nwithout all the standard windows crapware installed, but unless the Surface hits the sub $400 market it isn't going anywhere.  Google's Nexus tablet will\nprobably be announced next week and probably be under $200, so once again Microsoft will be playing catch up.  And where will this leave us?

The $40 upgrade price is\nanother huge proof that they are willing to do almost anything to get technorati (the only people who really ever do upgrade an\nOS without buying a new computer) on board and using Windows 8. And that they are probably correct to, as\nreleasing Windows 7.5 probably would be the end of versions for Windows and perhaps the start of the decline for Microsoft.\nOff topic a little, but not that I think the end of versions for Windows would be bad, I think it would be amazing if windows was more like\nChrome and just slowly updated itself over time.  However, I do know what an insane support headache that would be and that would be a no-go for businesses.\nMy suggestion would be to create two versions of the OS, the enthusiasts version that auto-updated like Chrome and the LTS\nversion that got released every three years.  Then they could be a little Lean in Windows development, however I\nam not sure you really want enthusiasts driving the boat for features.  Who knows, maybe that is what they are going to do with Windows RT,\nsince they haven't given it version number (though Vista and XP didn't have version numbers either).</p>\n<p>Sorry, go off topic there, back to the topic of the New Metro Interface.  Well, personally I am not a fan and I see it\nresulting in a ton of apps that look like the new Rdio.  But really I am not the right person to ask, given that I have no sense of design myself.\nDo I find it hard to use, not particularly but it did slow me down over a normal desktop. I am pretty sure that if I ever choose to use Windows 8\nI will get over that hump in a few days, but unfortunately for Microsoft neither myself nor Mr. Atwood are the customers that they have to worry about.\nWill business people adopt it in droves - highly unlikely but I don't think that Microsoft is counting on that.\nWill regular consumers like your unspecified relative who always asks you for computer help like it?  That is the real question, and they won't really\nhave a choice since it will be loaded onto their next computer.  The question is do they revolt, and if they do revolt do they jump to OSX?  From what I have heard,\nand since this is from my friends and tech pundits on podcasts, it is about 30-70 between love and hate of the new interface.\nI think the main problem is going to be that Windows RT is only half baked so far, and Microsoft doesn't have enough time to get a perfect version out the door.\nI am sure version 2 or 3 will be great, but will the masses have fled before that happens?</p>\n"},"./src/posts/older/2013-08-22-5-geeky-things-i-love-2013.md":{"mtime":1759408062239.9944,"content":"<p><a href=\"/lifehacks/2011/07/21/5-geeky-things-i-love/\">It's two years later</a> and time to re-evaluate or just expand upon the things I love.

It is not\na daily occurrence, but I've been using it enough that I thought I had a pretty good handle on it.  I have still yet to find a\nmetro app that appeals enough to use it for more than 5 minutes, but I had thought that after 8.1 maybe the bleeding for\nMicrosoft had stopped.  Boy was I wrong!</p>\n<p>I have basically turned Windows 8 into Windows 7 (the first thing I installed was <a href=\"http://www.classicshell.net/\">Classic Shell</a>\nand then migrated to <a href=\"http://www.stardock.com/products/start8/\">Start 8</a>).  I never see the Metro interface and even though I\nmiss Aero Glass, I find the experience OK.  It's not really any better than Windows 7, but it isn't that much worse for ME,\nbecause I had heard about Windows 8 long before using it, and knew about all the issues I basically had a bunch of workarounds\nthat made it work fine for me.</p>\n<p>However I realized this Christmas that this is not the case for people who do not spend their lives following computer news.  I\ngave Lisa, my wife, a new laptop for Christmas (she is mostly a Mac user but has an ancient (6 year old) Windows laptop that she uses for work).\nShe needed Maximizer and Simply accounting originally so she decided to get a windows laptop rather than a Mac one and\nI, perhaps foolishly, decided that I would continue on that course.  I picked a nice Asus ultrabook (not the super high end,\nbut hardly the low-end) that had a Core i5 and was a huge improvement in every way over her 2008 HP that she had been rocking.\nThe look of delight when she opened the wrapping paper and then box containing laptop gave me endless joy, &quot;It's so light!&quot;,\n&quot;It's so pretty!&quot;, &quot;I love it!&quot;</p>\n<p>The first bad sign was her Mom's offhand comment, &quot;Is that Windows 8?  Sherry bought a computer with that on it and She\nhates it&quot;.  Don't worry I assured her, &quot;it comes with Windows 8 but I'll upgrade it to 8.1 as soon as you have signed in.&quot;\nThe first few screens of the windows install process where ok, and although she was frustrated that she <strong>had</strong> to sign up for\na microsoft live account she accepted it.  The furst problem was the second after she finished the &quot;Personalization&quot; she\nwas taken to the Metro Home Screen.  This completely baffled her?  &quot;Where is my desktop?&quot;  &quot;What the fuck are all these boxes?&quot;\n&quot;I hate this, can't I just get my old desktop back?&quot;</p>\n<p>Once again I tried to come to the rescue.  &quot;Just click on the Desktop icon,&quot; I said.  &quot;It will bring you to the desktop.&quot;  &quot;What's the desktop icon,\nwhere is the desktop icon, I hate this!&quot; &quot;It's down their in the lower left corner&quot;  &quot;This is fucking stupid, why would they\nchange this.  On the Mac you just have your desktop&quot;  &quot;Don't worry, I'll fix it so you never have to see this screen again by upgrading to Windows 8.1,\nbut for now just Click on the Desktop Icon&quot;.  So I showed her where the desktop icon was (though it wasn't clear to her that it was the desktop wallpaper with the word\ndesktop written underneath it since she yet to see her desktop wallpaper which had been set up by Asus.  Next she wanted to install\nFirefox, &quot;OK I know need to run IE to install Firefox, how do I do that?&quot;  &quot;Ok,&quot; I said, &quot;In the lower right hand corner where the start menu\nused to be there is a rectangle, click on that&quot; &quot;I don't see it,&quot; she said.  &quot;Yeah, it's really hard to see,&quot; I agreed.  &quot;Just press the\nWindows Key&quot; &quot;Arghhh the boxes are back,&quot; she frustratingly cried.  &quot;I know, I know, you have to start everything from this screen until\nI fix it&quot;.  &quot;How do I start Internet Explorer?&quot;  &quot;Start typing Internet Explorer and it will show up&quot;  &quot;You are shitting me, who was the idiot\nwho thought this was a good idea?  This is stupid, bring me back my start menu and then I will try again.&quot;</p>\n<p>So I installed Classic Menu for her, and spent 2 hours trying to get the updates required to install Windows 8.1   First there were\nthe 80 updates in windows update that just sat there endlessly downloading until I realized that a reboot was required because new\nupdates had been installed.  It didn't tell me that, it just showed an endless progress bar but after waiting for 30 minutes I realized\nthat it wasn't working and the next step is trying to &quot;Turn it on and off again&quot;, where I saw that there where updates that needed to b\ninstalled before windows update could proceed.  Eventually I got everything done and had the download of 3Gigs going for Windows 8.1 so I let\nLisa back at it so she could install Firefox and Skype.  A few minutes later she was almost at the point of tears, Firefox had switched to\nsome malware site as its search engine, it had 4 toolbars added, and 4 or 5 pieces of malware had been installed on the system.  Apparently\nshe had googled Skype and clicked on the Ad which had wrapped Skype in some horrible malware.  This was all Windows 8's fault and it was\ntime to return the stupid laptop and get Macbook.  Never mind that it was double the price, nevermind that old laptop was fine except\nthat it was slow (and some Java Update thing was always poping up), Windows 8 was awful and nothing I could do could fix it.</p>\n<p>After calming her down, and spending an hour removing the malware I promised I remove windows 8 and install windows 7.  We'll see how that\ngoes, but this has left me feeling that even though before I thought Microsoft had repaired the damage caused by Windows 8 with\nWindows 8.1, I no longer think that is true.  I have never seen such a visceral reaction to something as the hatred Lisa showed to the\nMetro UI.  She spouted endless common sense, &quot;I don't see why they changed it?&quot;   &quot;Why should I have to learn something new that provides\nno benefit to me?&quot;  &quot;Mac's just work, they have a desktop and I can use them.  Where do I put all must documents if not on the desktop?&quot;\n&quot;How do normal who aren't computer experts use this?&quot;  &quot;It seems to me that they should have made the whole thing simpler not more complicated&quot;</p>\n<p>She hates Windows 8, her mother who has never used it hates Windows 8, their friends all hate Windows 8, and now they will be talking about\nhow bad Windows 8 is for months.  Maybe that is why <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/googles-chromebooks-amazon-best-sellers-2013-12\">Chromebooks have become the best selling laptops this Christmas</a>, their cheap, and simple.\nIf only Apple had $700 notebook option I probably would have returned the laptop and gotten that.</p>\n<p>Microsoft should have done 3 things with Windows 8.1, made the default option go to the desktop.  Bring back the Start Menu not just the Start Button.\nCreate a safe environment where major programs (like Firefox, Skype, etc) can be installed with there being no chance of Malware being installed.\nThe fact that major software like Java and Flash installs crapware by default is a blight on Windows eco-system and that will probably be\nend of Windows more than any other thing.  I know that Windows Store App (WinRT, Metro, whatever) are an attempt to create a safe sandboxed\nenvironment it is an absolute failure if desktop apps do not get the same functionality (allow power users to install anything they want but\ncreate a way to safely download required applications, life the Mac App store).  Also the current Windows 8 store is such a mess that they should\nburn it in a fire start again with proper vetting of applications.  You should not be able to create an app called\n<a href=\"http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/instagram-plus/e45813ad-85a1-4202-a5bc-25b4e77054a0\">Instagram Plus</a>\nor <a href=\"http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/f3d210e5-9b32-48f9-88de-3a3a02478735\">Intstagram Pro</a>\nand use the Instagram Logo and have the developers have nothing to do with Instagram.   I look at non-technical peoples computers\nwith all of the malware they have on them and feel that this is one thing Microsoft has to fix if Windows is going to survive\nas a consumer operating system.</p>\n<p>And this is why I believe that Windows 8 is still killing Microsoft, and until something is done to fix these 3 things the\nbleeding will continue.</p>\n"},"./src/posts/older/2013-12-30-the-end-of-the-windows-desktop.md":{"mtime":1759408062240.5442,"content":"<p>Google recently announced it's <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/launcher\">Chrome App Launcher</a>, and it has got me thinking about Native Windows Apps.\nI can't really think of the last big app that was launched on the desktop that hasn't been slowly migrating its way more effectively to the web.\nThere are some pretty decent Audio/Photo/Video editors on the web (though some require Flash), and the latest craze is Web only IDE's.  Even the <a href=\"http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/\">Unreal\nengine has been ported to Firefox</a>, and now Google is embrace/extending Chrome with it's App Launcher to be the\nnext cross platform dream.</p>\n<p>I don't really think that Google will succeed with this, it's just another of their throw it against the wall and see if it sticks (ala Chrome Frame and\nGoogle Gears and all the other ways that Google has tried to Chromize the default web experience) but it is interesting that Google is trying\nMicrosoft's <em>embrace, extend, eliminate</em> tactics from the late 1990's and early 2000's.  I see their Chrome Apps as akin to the old\nInternet Explorer ActiveX control that we all loved so much (with perhaps not as bad of a security model).  Firefox extensions grew organically\nout of Greasemonkey and the extension model that Firefox originally built in.  Chrome, however, developed its extension model on its own as it\nrealized it needed extensions to compete with Firefox.  The Chrome Apps extended from that as Chrome made it simple to package your URL as an\napplication and make another way for promote the app in the Chrome Web Store.  But if more applications are built this way, ChromeOS may start\nbecoming real competition for microsoft.  As I pointed out in <a href=\"/windows/2013/12/28/windows-8-is-still-killing-microsoft/\">Windows 8 is still killing Microsoft</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/googles-chromebooks-amazon-best-sellers-2013-12\">Chromebooks are becoming a real threat to windows</a> and as Google\ncontinues to improve Chrome they will become more of a threat.</p>\n<p>And I see Google's using its dominance in other areas too:  I switched to <a href=\"http://gmail.com\">Gmail</a> as my mail provider 6 months ago (mostly to see\nhow good Google Now was), but I've noticed that a lot of Google's competitors (or maybe in the case of Groupon, ex competitors as Google has shut\ndown offers) end up in my Spam folder and no matter how often I mark it as not spam it always ends up there.  Same with Chitika and Bing Ads some\nof their adword competitors.  I don't know if this is actually anti-competitive or accidental, I guess one should never ascribe malice what might\nbe incompetence, however Google is good at so many other things.  Or maybe Spam is just hard.</p>\n<p>However in adlink spam, Google seems to be much less proactive.  Currently, if you Google for Skype, an ad appears for a download site I will not\nmention or provide a link to (no need to improve their rankings) that wraps the Skype download in a metric butload of Malware.  4 toolbars, and\na bunch of programs that spy on you requiring a fair amount of work to de-infest the machine that it installed on.  Google happily takes their\nmoney and it gives both Skype and Windows a terrible reputation, which, is good for google.  The fact that when you google many common freeware\napplications the first site that shows up in Download.com (once again I won't link) is another disservice to Windows users as Download.com\nbasically wraps every download they have in 10 kinds of malware.  Google not blocking download sites that wreck the windows experience might be\ngood for Google Chrome but it is probably not good for google as the first thing much of this Malware does is switch your default search engine\nto yahoo or somewhere even worse.  So once again, this may be malice, or just that the google ranking algorithm doesn't yet take malware from\ndownloaded software into account.</p>\n<p>And then there is Google's refusal to port of any of their App's to Windows Phone.

Re-inventing the wheel is almost\nas foolish as choosing the wrong framework (and believe me I have done that enough times to be far too\ncautious about devoting too much time learning a framework or language -- heck I spent a bunch of time\nlearning <a href=\"http://pike.lysator.liu.se/\">Pike</a> rather than <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">Ruby</a> in the\n90's.

Mostly I will argue that copying the ActiveRecord pattern was my undoing, as whenever\nI have to use my framework (my wife's site for <a href=\"http://ammara.ca\">Dance Company Ammara</a> still uses it) it is the\ndatabase access that truly makes me shudder, but in my defence the golden age of PHP frameworks had yet to begin\nwhen I wrote it (Symfony2, Laravel, Phalcon where not out yet) and the choices for a frameworks all seemed lacking.\nThough I liked Symfony at the time, I felt that it was over-engineered for a PHP framework (it tried to be far too much\nlike Java frameworks like Struts) and running it on a shared hosting site without APC it was really slow.  So obviously\nI could write a better framework -- ah the hubris of youth.</p>\n<p>So when I looked at the state of Mobile frameworks I really tried to not write a new framework.  For my work we needed\nto quickly create a mobile application, and I spent a bunch of time researching the state of Mobile frameworks.  I made\nsome apps 3 years ago with <a href=\"http://jqtjs.com/\">jQtouch or jQT as they are now calling it</a>, and started working with it\nbut quickly found it lacking.  So I did a kind of mobile rundown of the big frameworks:</p>\n<p>Over the past year I have been working on my own mobile hobby App <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipefolder.app\">Recipe Folder</a>,\na kind of <a href=\"http://getpocket.com\">Pocket</a>/<a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/\">Instapaper</a>/ Readability (now defunct) for\nRecipes (using a <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recipe-folder/nfgkogochmmkkglclaokmangionbpmha\">Chrome Extension</a> or\n<a href=\"http://recipe-folder.com\">Bookmarklet</a> you can save any Recipes you find on the web and then access them\nlater on your Mobile device).  It was written using jQuery Mobile, and that is a mistake I would never make again.</p>\n<p>I also looked at some of the commercial options (specifically <a href=\"http://phonejs.devexpress.com/\">PhoneJS</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kendoui.com/mobile.aspx\">KendoUI Mobile</a>,\nbut once again the size of the framework scared me off.  Its not <strong>just</strong> that adding 1/2 a Meg of minified Javascript\non a mobile device seems like a bad idea, it is the problem of edge cases that you always run into when working with a framework when you\ndiscover that the framework doesn't do quite what you expect and you need to change it.  Frequently when things aren't working\nthe way you would expect I like walking through the source to see what is going on, and with huge code bases that sometimes\njust isn't possible.</p>\n<p>I also looked at <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/touch\">Sencha</a> and would seriously consider it for a large project I was writing by myself, however the complexity\nof learning the platform and the time to build apps in it makes it a bit of a non-starter.  It would take anyone who had\nto work on the project a few weeks to get up to speed with the framework, and thereby diminishes the advantages of\nrapidly developing an app in HTML5 Javascript.  Let me be very clear, the Topcoat Touch framework is designed for small apps,\nthat are only couple of pages and do not have a lot of data binding.  If you are building a giant mobile application seriously\nlook into Sencha or using a framework like Angular (see <a href=\"http://coenraets.org/blog/2013/11/sample-mobile-application-with-angularjs\">Topcoat with Angular</a>\nfor a good example of how to mix Angular with Topcoat).</p>\n<p>My decision after watching a couple of excellent (and highly recommended) Phonegap presentations by\n<a href=\"http://coenraets.org/blog/2013/05/top-10-performance-techniques-for-phonegap-applications\">Christopher Coenraets</a> and\n<a href=\"http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/09/30/spideroak\">Tommy Williams</a> was to go without a framework at all.\nHowever, after examining the source code for Christopher's <a href=\"http://coenraets.org/blog/2013/06/building-modular-web-applications-with-backbone-js-and-requirejs-sample-app\">Backbone/RequireJS example</a>\nand starting to write code without a framework I realized that there was a bunch of repetative programming chores that\nI could encapsulate into a framework.  There were also a few things that I really liked about the old jQTouch\nand that I could probably very quickly write a <a href=\"http://microjs.com\">micro-framework</a> that could acheive almost all of them.\nI could throw in <a href=\"http://cubiq.org/fyi-iscroll-is-out-of-beta\">iScroll</a> (I needed scrolling) and <a href=\"https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick\">Fastclick</a>\nas optional micro-libraries and Bob's your uncle I would have  exactly what I wanted.  A tiny framework that could be easily extended, easily altered and was\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kriserickson/topcoat-touch/wiki/Getting-Started\">very fast to learn</a>.\nAnd Voila! we now have <a href=\"https://github.com/kriserickson/topcoat-touch\">Topcoat Touch</a>.</p>\n"},"./src/posts/older/2014-01-24-trying-too-hard-to-make-uncool-cool.md":{"mtime":1759408062240.9988,"content":"<h4 id=\"...-or-embracing-the-suck\" tabindex=\"-1\">... Or Embracing the Suck</h4>\n<p>I've had a Yahoo Mail account for almost 15 years, at the time I got it it was basically for travelling\nwhere accessing a POP server from a Web Cafe was not possible or would have been a real pain in the but.\nEven when I got it back in 1999 there was a shortage of names available.  Of course kris and kriserickson\nand kerickson were all gone, so I tried kson34 which was my university account name.  The univeristy account\nname was autogenerated by the university as the first letter of my first name,last 3 letters of your last name,\nplus however many kson's the University had had before me -- so no, 34 was not\nmy age when I got the email or the year I was born (I'm old, but not that old).  However when I tried something\nas cryptic as kson34 as my user name the name was also already taken (this is perhaps the first time I realized\nhow big Yahoo and the internet really were) and it came back with a bunch of suggestions - ksoncan34 was the\none I took.  What has always annoyed me about the Yahoo Mail was that because I took the yahoo.ca version mail\nsent to ksoncan34@yahoo.com does not arrive to me, it just goes into the ether (since I own the .ca version,\nno one can own ksoncan34@yahoo.com -- maybe Marissa can fix this issue, but I doubt its high on the list of\nproblems with Yahoo Mail).</p>\n<p>So that is why I have a cryptic Yahoo Mail address, however it hardly explains why I have kept using that\nyahoo address when Yahoo Mail is so terrible.  I got an invite to and had an account with Gmail since late 2004,\nand initially considered moving mail from yahoo to Gmail.  However, 5 years of piling up people with my Yahoo\naddress had kept me trapped in their eco-system.  Plus an interesting thing began to happen, yahoo started got\nvery scared of Gmail and finally improved Yahoo Mail.  No longer was it a weekly task to delete old mail (the original\nYahoo mail was limited to what is now a very laughable 10 megs of storage) as the mail size improved to 2GB (the same\nsize the Gmail boasted they were starting with) and if got in on the Yahoo mail beta the interface was almost better\nthan Gmail's (if you didn't buy into Gmail's system of tags and archiving everything).  So because my yahoo address was\nout there, and yahoo mail kept improving, my Gmail account was basically my spam account (Gmail used to be better than\nYahoo mail at Spam, now for me, they are <a href=\"/2013/12/30/the-end-of-the-windows-desktop\">a little too aggressive</a>).\nThat changed earlier this year when as part of my switch to android, I started forwarding all my mail to Gmail and\nstarted reading mail through Gmail as non-Gmail clients on Android suck (this finally was fixed in Android 4.4) and\nI couldn't take advantage of many of the Google Now features without pushing my mail through Gmail.</p>\n<p>However I have resisted in informing anyone of this change (though as I respond to mail from Gmail that was sent to my\nYahoo address this cause my Yahoo mail address to eventually get lost) since I am kind of enjoying the trailer trash\nchic of having an email address from the wrong side of the tracks (not that yahoo is dangerous, more like it's a <a href=\"http://www.vancouverspecial.com/\">Vancouver Special</a>.\nI am trying to make it the new hipster thing to rock a Yahoo address (good luck with that).  Although now that Gmail is largest email provider on the planet,\nit hardly seems unique or techy to have a Gmail address.  And so I also keep the ksoncan34 moniker in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ksoncan34\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>I also run Windows as my operating system, both at work and at home.  At a time when almost all developers (at least\nall the ones I see at conferences and tech talks and most of the demos I see on the internet) run OSX (usually on a\nretina Macbook Pro) I eschew the Mac's coolness for the suck that is Windows.  It's a bunch of things, when I was\nyounger and spent far more on computer hardware I always stuck with windows and not OSX or Linux because games (at least\nthe AAA titles) were unavailable except on PC.  Nowadays, however, I really only play games on the console so that is\nno longer an excuse.  Another thing has always been the cost, yes, Apple produces quality hardware which is difficult\nto find elsewhere, but there has always been a premium associated with it.</p>\n<p>And although I love the underpinnings of OSX (having a true Unix shell available without having to install <a href=\"www.cygwin.com\">Cygwin</a> or\n<a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=full+installer+for+official+git\">msysgit</a> and deal with the\nincompatibilities there.  Having a <a href=\"http://brew.sh/\">package manager</a> (<a href=\"http://www.macports.org/\">two actually</a>), rather than\nthe admittedly clever hack that is <a href=\"http://chocolatey.org/\">Chocolatey</a> is a definite bonus.  There are a few things that\njust drive me crazy about OSX that I can't bring myself to use it -- starting with the Finder.  Even in &quot;Windows 3.1&quot; days\nWindows had a better file manager, and though I claim to be a command line person, there is a real productivity with proper\ntree based file management that Apple still doesn't have, and unbelievably there are no good third party replacements for.\nQuite a few decisions about how things like how the Home and End keys work (though I finally found a <a href=\"https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/\">solutions to that\nand other Keyboard annoyances</a>), why would anyone want the End key to go to the\nEnd of the document, is that a frequent action for many people?  And yes, as a programmer, I <strong>do</strong> want to go to the end of the\nline all the time!  Every time I use OSX I have to deal with dozens of little quirks (that I am sure if you were a longtime\nMac user seem sensible) that drive me crazy, and make it a non-starter to switch.</p>\n<img style=\"border: 1px solid #000; margin: 10px\" src=\"/img/uncool/windows-trailer.jpg\">\n<p>All said and done this may be the year I finally bite the bullet and switch to Linux, but for now I will run the Double Wide of\noperating systems and embrace the suck.</p>\n"},"./src/posts/older/2014-02-11-switching-to-android-6-months-later.md":{"mtime":1759408062241.1143,"content":"<p>I bought a Nexus 4 at the end of August when they dropped to $199.  My iPhone 4 was barely holding on and I had grown\nfrustrated with Apple's walled garden for the past few years.  A month later even though I quite liked the Nexus 4\nI upgraded to the Nexus 5, here are my thoughts on that switch:</p>\n<p>The iPhone was amazing when it came out, truly amazing.  It had a almost a five year lead on the competition, however\nit seemed like because of the initial work done, IOS upgrades were very incremental (at least until IOS 7).  From the\nbeginning Apple was very tied to its walled garden (or benevolent caretaker) approach, in that you were stuck Apple's\npoorer quality apps.  It has kind of amazed me that although Apple apps where initially best of breed, Google and other\ncompanies had been creating the best Apps on IOS for a while, and those Apps were hobbled because there was no way\nof setting them as the default handler for basic things like Mail, Maps, and Web Browsing.  I probably would have stuck\nwith IOS if they had changed that one thing in IOS7, the ability to register other Apps as the default app.  In my last\ncouple of years on IOS I had switched to Google Maps as my default Maps, Chrome as my default browser, (I still used\nthe Mail app because it was still superior to everything else out there).  Every time I clicked on a link that opened up\nSafari or the Apple maps and I had to copy the url or location and re-open it in my environment of choice made the\nswitch more inevitable.</p>\n<p>And then there was the Nexus 7, the cheap little tablet that convinced me that Android was not as bad as I remembered\nfrom the 2.3 Gingerbread era.  There were slowly starting to be quality apps made for Android, and some apps on Android\nwere even better than the equivalent on IOS.  I truly believe that the Nexus 7 and a couple of other inexpensive quality\ntablets were the reason that a lot of technical people realized that Android was finally getting to a point where it\nwas as polished as IOS and that the state of Apps was really improving.</p>\n<blockquote>***Digression*** It's not the number of Apps that are on a platform, it's having the apps that you need/want\nand the quality of those apps.   There are almost 150,000 apps in the Windows 8 store and when I first started using Windows 8\nI literally could not find one that I wanted to use.  I really\nwanted to try the Windows 8 experience and I downloaded apps that I had been told where of excellent quality and I never used\nany of them more than 1 minute of trying them out.   Netflix and Kindle were actually better in a browser, and the rest of the\napps I tried had no compelling to use them.  The number of Apps available on a platform is a canard (that thankfully is\nis going away) up there with the mghz wars of the late nineties.\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so after deciding to switch to Android in August, and switching in September here are my thoughts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Until quite recently iPhone build quality was superior to all of the android phones, which maintained had remained plastic\nand not copied the metal finishing of the iPhone 4.  In devices like the HTC One and Nexus 5 the build quality was finally\nat parity with what apple had achieved and with the Nexus 5 at a considerable savings to the iPhone (almost half the price).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I was OK with the Nexus 4, it didn't thrill me as a phone (and it should have given that I had switched from a very underpowered\niPhone 4 that was barely usable), however the Nexus 5 still gives me a feeling of awe every day I use it (The iPhone 3G and the iPhone 4\ndid the same thing for almost a year and half so let's see if the Nexus 5 lasts that long).  And it's not that the Nexus 5 is so\nmuch more powerful than the Nexus 4, it literally is the build quality on things like the case.  It feels like an amazing\nphone which is something that few Android phones have done to this day (the HTC-One is the only other Android phone that\n<em><strong>feels</strong></em> awesome.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I actually like IOS7 (though I have only used it for short periods of time testing and building my\n<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/recipe-folder/id796838333?mt=8\">Recipe Folder app for IOS</a>) so the switch to IOS7 was not the\nreason of switch other than hearing it wasn't changing the policy about setting default applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IOS still has better niche apps, the $2-3 apps that <a href=\"http://blog.flurry.com/bid/99013/The-History-of-App-Pricing-And-Why-Most-Apps-Are-Free\">Android users won't pay for</a>.\nPersonally I believe that is changing, but until App developers build quality Apps IOS will continue to have better apps.  An example\nis <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/stop-motion-studio/id441651297?mt=8\">Stop Motion Studio</a> and there are several other really\ngood stop motion apps on the iphone, however as much as I have looked the same Apps on Android suck.\nThey look terrible and they perform even worse (and this is on a Nexus 5, I can't imagine using this on a low end device).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n    <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sheado.lite.stopmotion&amp;hl=en\"><img alt=\"Stop Motion App\" style=\"display:inline; margin: 10px; width: 250px\" src=\"https://lh5.ggpht.com/Ysqc41ANxJhjCkLpZmph0sAhithZaI1RgIXuxOL-ukQFIdc85zdtGrfqItW-oEI72Co=h900-rw\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sheado.lite.stopmotion&amp;hl=en\"><img alt=\"Stop Motion App 2\" style=\"display:inline; margin: 10px; width: 250px\" src=\"https://lh6.ggpht.com/_0FTDdsLrwGIxXNh8ksgV90WyEz5L6O1KIBzxe_ld1Ro-UNfN7NvEdkTZhF42qvKARg=h310-rw\"></a>\n</div>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<p>The camera is still terrible.  It's not that it take terrible pictures, you can get the Nexus 5 to take very good pictures,\nits that the camera App is so lacking on stock android and other Apps (ZoomFX, haven't been able to get the control that they need to take great pictures.  Hopefully this\nis something that is fixed Android 5, as hints of the underlying <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/lbk003/an-devcon2013-camera3kaurfinal\">Camera3 API's</a> became visible in 4.4.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are a lot of things to love about Android, beyond simply the open nature of the platform.  The lock screen can do whatever\nyou want, something you can only do with a Jailbroken IOS device.  Widgets are a huge feature that IOS is still missing.  And the\nflexibility you have with the device is almost daunting (especially if you install something like <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm\">Tasker</a>),\nit really is a tinker's dream.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Although completely unrelated to owning a device, developing for Android is both easier and harder than developing for IOS.  It is easier as the tooling is much better\nand far more sane (I know it's not true for everyone, but I <a href=\"/programming/2010/07/19/coding-like-its-1999/\">still find using XCode an excruciating experience</a>\nand Objective C is a language only a mother could love).  However the dozens of screen sizes make developing a good looking\napp much harder than it is for the 3 sizes that you need to develop on IOS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However all those things said, I would still tell someone who does not have a smartphone to get an iPhone and unless you\nhave a real reason to switch from the iPhone or are fairly technically minded and want to take advantage of flexibility Android\ngives you, stick with the iPhone.  Unless of course you want to buy an unlocked phone, in which case <em><strong>definately</strong></em> get the Nexus 5,\nas the value for money there is spectacular.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To make it simple for you I have created a simple flow chart on how to buy a phone (oh and if you switch as well, read <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+EricSchmidt/posts/JcfVoJhW2Kw\">Eric Schmidt's\nGoogle+ post on how to switch from IOS to Android</a></p>\n<img src=\"/img/android_switch/what_phone_to_buy.png\">\n"},"./src/posts/older/2014-03-13-tools-for-the-modern-web-developer-on-windows.md":{"mtime":1759408062241.3022,"content":"<p>Be a windows developer in the web world sucks.

This may be heresy, and it\nis probably because I am getting old, but writing code without constant static analysis is cowboys who think\nthat they are better programmers than they are.  Everybody makes mistakes and computers are getting better and\nbetter at finding them.  For me the JetBrains tools are the best finding errors, refactoring, and so many\nother things that installing them is one of the first things I do on any machine.

And the path\nconfusion in cygwin especially when running non-cygwin utilities is more of a headache than it is worth.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ninite.com\">Ninite</a> is a great tool to get up and running on a new PC, it basically packages a script to install\na bunch of programs and then downloads and installs them.  A lot of the programs I am recommending are available on\nNinite and I have yet to have it install any Malware (Toolbars, etc) when it installs a program.  Rather than\njumping to 20-30 websites you can have it do its magic while you are doing something else (it doesn't even\nprompt you so you can actually work at your computer while it is installing things).  It isn't a package manager\nbecause it doesn't keep things up to date, but it is a lot better than the old way of doing thing.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chocolatey.org/\">Chocolatey</a> - is another software package manager that help you install programs, though because\nit is a hack on top of NuGet that throws installers and exe's into a package manager it is not like a real package manager\nlike apt, yum, ports, homebrew or macports, it doesn't really know too much about versions and thus is not great\nat keeping the versions up to date.  Also be aware that sometimes it has two installers, one that runs an exe installer\nand one that just installs the .exe into Chocolatey itself.  For something like Node you want to install the exe\nor you don't get NPM.  The Chocolatey package naming convention is that if there is a local install it will just have\nthe name and if there is an installer run it gets the name + .install.  So you want to cinst nodejs.install not cinst nodejs.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/\">Secunia</a> since we don't have nice package managers on windows, we\nhave to rely on tools like Secunia to tell us when programs are out of date and potential security risks.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">Git</a> and <a href=\"http://github.com\">Github</a> work fine on Windows now, and Github is probably the\ngreatest thing about open source these days.

You don't necessarily need a screenshot\ntool (Snipping Tool is pretty good or just Ctrl-PrtScr), but you do need to swap out the atrocious Windows Photo Viewer as\nthe default graphics viewer with <a href=\"http://www.irfanview.com/\">Irfanview</a>.  **Warning: Irfanview default download is download.net,\nwhich wraps it's downloads in crapware, fosshob and tucows still to my knowledge do not. Be careful when installing\nsome of these programs, most of the toolbars are installed by default when you select the default setup.  That warning\ngoes for winscp as well as Sourceforge has started wrapping some of it's downloads as well.  Also if you do download\nthese apps one at a time from Google search be very careful, malware companies are buying ads on google that look\nlike the real software company and wrap the application in malware.  It is the scourge of windows and may be the main\nreason for Windows death. **</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Nodejs</a>, <a href=\"http://rubyinstaller.org/\">Ruby</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.python.org/downloads/windows/\">Python</a>.  You may\nnever program in any of these languages, but lots of tools you will be using will require them.  Get the 1.9 ruby and the 2.7\npython unless you are actually working in the languages as all of the tools are still based off of the older versions. For Ruby\nyou may be required to install the DevKit (http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) as well.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.rapidee.com\">Rapid Environment Editor</a>, you really want a few programs in your path (your text editor for\nexample), and this is the best tool I have found for setting up your Path and other environment variables.</li>\n<li>I always need a merge tool, and I use <a href=\"http://winmerge.org/\">Winmerge</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.scootersoftware.com/\">Beyond Compare</a> is\nalso excellent but does cost $30 (which is pretty reasonable).

You may not have the prettiest hardware, but you do have the fact that\nuntil the last few years tons of desktop was designed for windows that never got ported to Mac or Linux.
