## Introduction to Unsupervised Learning

[Unsupervised learning[](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/unsupervised-learning) refers to the class of machine learning methods that find patterns in unlabeled data without any predefined targets or categories

. Unlike supervised learning, where models learn from labeled examples, unsupervised algorithms discover hidden structures in the data on their own. Common goals of unsupervised learning include clustering (grouping similar data points together) and dimensionality reduction (compressing data features while retaining important information)
