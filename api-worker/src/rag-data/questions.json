      "context": "At Storefront—a small company that ultimately ran with a tight, high-impact development group—Kris led delivery by coordinating closely with the development team and project managers while partnering directly with key business stakeholders to decide what to build next and why, consistently prioritizing the work that delivered the most value. In his Director of Software Development role, he owned the practical “glue” work: aligning goals, translating business outcomes into clear technical plans, unblocking execution, and keeping the roadmap grounded in real constraints and customer impact. He also invested heavily in team growth, mentoring senior engineers while coaching newer developers across a wide range of backgrounds—from boot-camp grads with strong prior careers to PhD-level hires who were brilliant technically but new to shipping software in a business context—so the team could move faster without sacrificing quality or reliability."

      "name": "What major projects has Kris led?",
      "context": "Kris has led multiple long-running, revenue-critical product lines at Storefront, taking them from early concept through years (and decades) of real-world production operation across major retail partners. The work spans a white-label e-commerce platform, high-volume in-store kiosk systems, distributed remote management at massive device scale, and customer-facing file transfer and payment flows that materially changed adoption, revenue, and loss prevention.\n\n1) Storefront White-Label E-Commerce Platform (1999/2000–present)\n\nThe Storefront platform began in 1999 as a consulting engagement, but in early 2000 Kris helped drive the evolution into a configurable, white-label e-commerce product. A pivotal early milestone came when a platform customer asked Storefront to create an online photo ordering system for the Windows XP era. In 2001, online photo ordering was a rapidly expanding market with comparatively few established competitors, and that customer request became the catalyst for Storefront’s strategic shift toward photo commerce.\n\nKris led the transformation from “generic commerce” into “photo commerce”: building systems that supported photo-specific workflows (uploading, previewing, editing, product configuration), expanded product catalogs (prints evolving into photo products and print-on-demand), and the operational realities of photo fulfillment and retail integration. Critically, this wasn’t a one-off storefront—it became a repeatable platform used by 10+ major retailers and partners, including Rite Aid, Fred Meyer, King Soopers, Smith’s, Duane Reade, Benavides, Fuji Mexico, and CVS Mexico.\n\nThe platform also enabled cross-channel behavior that mattered commercially: a significant share of revenue came from mixed journeys—customers ordering online and printing/picking up via kiosk, or starting in-store and completing on the web. That kind of “web ↔ kiosk” continuity is hard to get right because it requires consistent product rules, order state, pricing/promotions, identity/session bridging, and predictable fulfillment handoffs. Kris led the engineering decisions and sequencing that kept the system evolvable while still stable enough to run for decades.\n\n2) Windows Photo Kiosk Platform (millions of prints, $1B+ sales influence)\n\nBuilding on the photo-commerce shift, Kris helped lead the creation of Storefront’s Windows Photo Kiosk product line—the in-store consumer experience that processed millions of prints and contributed to over $1B in sales across the business (with revenue split roughly 50/50 between kiosk and web, plus a large volume of orders that started on the web and were printed at the kiosk).\n\nThese kiosks weren’t “a screen on a PC.” They were full retail systems that had to be resilient, easy for non-technical store staff to support, and operationally predictable across thousands of locations. Kris led the product and technical direction that made the kiosk a real platform: the customer UI and ordering flow, the integration points to printing/lab systems and inventory constraints, and the end-to-end transaction path that retail partners could operationalize.\n\nStorefront also iterated on the kiosk concept into adjacent products as consumer behavior shifted—like a ringtone kiosk and a music kiosk (including CD burning and iPod upload workflows). That wasn’t novelty; it demonstrated Kris’s ability to reuse core platform capabilities (catalog, pricing, UI patterns, fulfillment/entitlements, operational telemetry) while adapting the product to the constraints and customer expectations of different eras.\n\n3) Remote Management & Monitoring Platform (30,000+ devices, 12,000+ requests/min)\n\nKris led the development and expansion of a remote management platform that started as “kiosk monitoring” and evolved into a distributed control plane for an entire fleet of retail devices and connected services. At scale, this platform supported 30,000+ devices and backend throughput on the order of 12,000 requests per minute, while also being robust enough to support multi-country deployments and varied retail environments.\n\nThe impact was both operational and financial:\n\nEliminated massive field-visit costs: Early in the Rite Aid rollout, the company responsible for in-store installs reportedly made 2x what Storefront made selling kiosk software—because every update and fix required expensive hands-on service visits. Kris’s remote update capability changed that equation: software could be rolled out and patched without spending six figures on in-store visits every time something needed to change.\n\nReduced downtime with actionable telemetry: The platform didn’t just say “a kiosk is down.” It enabled Storefront to detect and act on real retail failure modes—kiosks out of paper, stuck states, device health issues—so Storefront could notify store staff to fix problems quickly and restore sales.\n\nImproved funnel performance via real usage signals: Kris used the telemetry to identify where customers abandoned the flow (which pages or steps drove drop-off), enabling targeted UX and reliability improvements that directly impacted completion rate and revenue.\n\nMade sales/accounting trustworthy in messy retail realities: In some deployments, kiosk orders were paid at the counter. The remote system enabled accurate sales figures so shrinkage (loss/theft/mismatches) could be identified and addressed—critical for retail partner trust and for maintaining the program at scale.\n\nOver time, the remote management foundation expanded beyond Windows kiosks to cover lab/print systems, experiments like digital advertising, and later device generations including Android kiosks—showing that Kris didn’t build a one-generation tool, but a durable operational platform that could adapt as hardware and retail strategies changed.\n\n4) Kiosk File Transfer + Payment System (Node.js/React) — adoption + shrinkage wins\n\nKris led the creation of a modern file transfer system designed to remove a major point of friction: customers previously had to plug phones into kiosks or bring flash drives/memory cards. The new flow let customers scan a barcode and upload photos to the kiosk without physical connection—cleaner, faster, and far more aligned with how people actually carried photos as smartphones took over.\n\nThe outcome was immediate and measurable: kiosk usage increased ~50% once customers no longer had to plug their phones in.\n\nThe project then expanded from “transfer” into “payments” using the same core infrastructure: session identification + secure handoff. Kris recognized that if you can securely connect a user’s phone session to a kiosk session, you can also use that to handle payment in a way that reduces both friction and risk. That meant:\n\nreducing the need for customers to type credit card details on a public kiosk, and\n\navoiding expensive payment hardware devices in the kiosk itself.\n\nWhen payment was introduced through this infrastructure, sales increased and shrinkage disappeared—a rare combination that retail partners love because it improves both top-line revenue and loss prevention at the same time.\n\n5) Distributed SaaS platform for customizable products (shared services across channels)\n\nAlongside the core kiosk + web business, Kris also led/owned substantial parts of a distributed SaaS platform that supported customizable products and shared capabilities across channels (web, kiosk, mobile). The through-line here is not just “built services,” but building operable services—systems designed to be monitored, debugged, rolled out safely, and incrementally modernized while keeping revenue systems running.\n\nLeadership and team impact (how he led these efforts)\n\nAcross these projects, Kris led engineering in a way that matched Storefront’s reality: a small company where priorities must be chosen carefully and every developer needs leverage. At peak, he coordinated a team of ~15 developers, averaged around 10, and delivered major outcomes even in the final year with a team of ~6. He coordinated between engineering and project managers, worked directly with key business partners to prioritize the roadmap for maximum stakeholder value, and kept delivery grounded in what would move revenue, reliability, and partner trust.\n\nHe also built strong teams by mentoring across a wide range of backgrounds—supporting senior developers while helping newer engineers ramp quickly, from boot-camp graduates with prior careers to PhD hires who were technically strong but new to business software delivery. That mentorship mattered because Storefront’s products weren’t toy apps—they were mission-critical systems running in retail, where reliability, operational clarity, and trust with partners determine whether the program grows or gets shut down."

      "name": "How has Kris worked with AI/ML technologies?",
      "context": "Kris has applied AI/ML in real production photo systems for more than a decade—well before the current LLM boom—primarily through computer vision for consumer photo workflows. At Storefront, he built and evolved imaging capabilities used across the Windows Photo Kiosk and online photo ordering platform, including automated photo enhancements (color correction pipelines), classic consumer-photo fixes (red-eye reduction), and practical image analysis features built largely on OpenCV.\n\nThat work spanned multiple platform generations:\n- Windows kiosk era: OpenCV-based imaging ran directly on Windows kiosks, and the Storefront Imaging API was initially Windows-only.\n- Modernization era (2019+): the imaging stack was moved to Linux and .NET Core (early .NET Core 1.1 timeframe), preserving core photo workflows while modernizing deployment and operations.\n- Android kiosk era: imaging capabilities were also delivered on Android as a Java service that leveraged cross-compiled OpenCV C components—adapting the same CV foundation to mobile/embedded constraints.\n\nKris’s computer-vision work focused on features that made large consumer photo libraries usable and improved downstream product generation quality. A key example was similar-image stacking: Kris implemented near-duplicate grouping so users saw clean stacks instead of long runs of essentially identical photos. The implementation combined perceptual hashing (pHash), color-histogram similarity, and capture date/time signals to robustly cluster real-world images despite minor edits, lighting shifts, or burst-mode sequences. He also implemented face detection and intelligent auto-cropping for templated products—especially auto-photobook generation—with support for multiple faces, safe margins, and aspect-ratio constraints so crops looked intentional rather than random. Kris additionally explored early OpenCV-style classification signals (e.g., coarse scene/object indicators like grass/animals) as groundwork for richer organization/search experiences, though Storefront never shipped a full search product on top of those labels.\n\nIn his final year at Storefront, Kris expanded into modern generative AI and LLM-driven product work with a pragmatic, production-minded approach:\n- Image-processing automation: he prototyped Python-based pipelines initially using PyTorch, later switching portions to Pillow when deterministic image processing was the better fit than model-driven approaches.\n- Image generation integrations: he integrated multiple image-generation APIs (including DALL·E, Stability.ai, and Flux) to explore a key customer promise—helping users produce a sellable product image without requiring Photoshop-level skills. In practice, this also enabled demo-ready experiences without requiring customers to supply source imagery; analytics showed negligible direct sales impact, but it validated UX flows and reduced demo friction.\n- LLM product-description generation: he built an early-stage system to generate improved product descriptions for Storefront’s customizable-products SaaS platform. It combined existing product descriptions with user-supplied creation metadata (title and other inputs) and LLM-derived classification of the user’s created image to produce more complete, consistent copy.\n\nTo operate these AI features responsibly and cost-effectively—especially the more expensive image generation—Kris implemented an ‘AI proxy’ layer that enforced practical safeguards. The proxy focused on abuse prevention, cost control, and safe operation (e.g., gating and filtering requests, limiting expensive calls, and ensuring the system could be monitored and throttled), rather than relying on a fully developed brand-voice or editorial workflow, since the description generator was still early-stage.\n\nKris has also experimented with model adaptation and fine-tuning techniques (e.g., LoRA and related lightweight approaches) using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers. However, he deliberately did not ship fine-tuned models to production: the available domain data was insufficient to outperform strong, low-cost foundation models, and in evaluations—particularly around the product-description generator—small/cheap hosted foundation models consistently outperformed locally-run or fine-tuned attempts.\n\nSeparately, Kris has used AI-assisted coding tools since 2021 (e.g., GitHub Copilot and newer agentic/IDE workflows like Cursor/Windsurf-style environments) as a force multiplier for prototyping and refactoring, while maintaining senior-engineering rigor around correctness, maintainability, and operational ownership."
