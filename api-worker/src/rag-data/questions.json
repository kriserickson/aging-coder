      "name": "What are Kris's key technical skills?",
      "context": "Kris is a full-stack, production-first engineer and technical leader with 25+ years delivering and operating customer-facing systems across web, mobile, and large retail device fleets. His differentiator is breadth with real depth: he can design architecture, implement the hard parts end-to-end, and keep systems reliable and evolvable over years—especially under real constraints (retail hardware, multi-channel flows, legacy migrations, and revenue-critical uptime).\n\n**Languages (real production experience):** TypeScript, JavaScript, PHP, C#, Python, Java, Kotlin, Swift, VB, and C, with earlier production work in Perl and Ruby.\n\n**Frontend engineering (web UI at scale):** Kris is highly fluent in TypeScript/JavaScript and comfortable shipping complex SPAs and PWAs in Vue and React (also Angular). He handles the unglamorous but critical parts of frontends—state complexity, performance tuning, incremental migration, build tooling, and keeping UI codebases maintainable as they grow.\n\n**Runtimes & frameworks (pragmatic backend delivery):** Kris has built substantial backends and service layers across multiple ecosystems and can move between them based on the problem and team context:\n- **Node.js / TypeScript:** Express, Hapi, Hono, Next.js, Nuxt\n- **.NET / C#:** .NET Core, ASP.NET Core\n- **PHP:** Laravel, Symfony, Slim\n- **Python:** FastAPI\n\nHe’s comfortable designing and implementing REST and GraphQL APIs, integrating third-party partners, and building service boundaries that support multi-channel systems (web ↔ kiosk ↔ mobile) where correctness, reliability, and operability matter.\n\n**Distributed systems & operational engineering:** Kris has designed and supported systems with real-world distributed constraints—retries, idempotency, safe rollouts, telemetry, and failure handling. He’s comfortable with event-driven and messaging patterns (especially with solace) and with building the operational tooling required to keep systems stable in production.\n\n**Mobile & device platforms:** Kris has built and shipped on Android and iOS, including native work in Kotlin/Java and Swift, plus cross-platform development (Flutter, Cordova). He’s comfortable with service-style components and bridging to compiled/native libraries when needed—an important skill set when products extend beyond browsers into kiosks and other field-deployed devices.\n\n**Databases, caching, and data plumbing:** Kris works confidently across relational and NoSQL stores including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, and CouchDB. He understands the tradeoffs between transactional correctness, throughput, caching, and operational simplicity—particularly in systems where reporting, payments, and partner trust depend on reliable numbers.\n\n**DevOps, CI/CD, and operability:** Kris is hands-on with Docker and Kubernetes and has built/maintained CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins. He approaches DevOps as ‘make it operable’: repeatable deployments, safe releases, and strong observability so teams can diagnose issues quickly and avoid costly downtime.\n\n**Observability & production diagnostics:** Kris has worked with and shipped systems instrumented using Kibana, OpenSearch, OpenTelemetry, Sentry, New Relic, and Splunk. He uses observability to drive outcomes—debugging production issues, identifying customer friction/abandonment points, and improving system reliability—rather than treating monitoring as a box-check.\n\n**AI/ML & applied computer vision:** Kris has 10+ years of applied ML/CV experience in production photo workflows, primarily using OpenCV across Windows kiosk, Linux/.NET Core imaging services, and Android service implementations. He’s also hands-on with modern AI stacks (PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Scikit-learn) and LLM workflow patterns, with a pragmatic bias toward approaches that actually outperform in production (e.g., leveraging strong low-cost foundation models when fine-tuning data/ROI isn’t there).\n\n**Cloud exposure (transparent scope):** Kris has worked within systems deployed on AWS/GCP/Azure and understands the operational concepts, but he’s transparent that he has not built greenfield infrastructure from scratch in those clouds and still has depth to build there. He learns quickly and is comfortable operating within existing cloud environments.\n\n**Modernization under constraints:** Kris has repeatedly modernized long-lived revenue systems—migrating stacks (including Windows-only components to Linux/.NET Core), introducing proven technologies at the right time, and keeping legacy and modern systems interoperable without breaking the business."

      "context": "At Storefront—a small company that ultimately ran with a tight, high-impact development group—Kris led delivery by coordinating closely with the development team and project managers while partnering directly with key business stakeholders to decide what to build next and why, consistently prioritizing the work that delivered the most value. In his Director of Software Development role, he owned the practical “glue” work: aligning goals, translating business outcomes into clear technical plans, unblocking execution, and keeping the roadmap grounded in real constraints and customer impact. He also invested heavily in team growth, mentoring senior engineers while coaching newer developers across a wide range of backgrounds—from boot-camp grads with strong prior careers to PhD-level hires who were brilliant technically but new to shipping software in a business context—so the team could move faster without sacrificing quality or reliability."

      "name": "What major projects has Kris led?",
      "context": "Kris has led multiple long-running, revenue-critical product lines at Storefront, taking them from early concept through years (and decades) of real-world production operation across major retail partners. The work spans a white-label e-commerce platform, high-volume in-store kiosk systems, distributed remote management at massive device scale, and customer-facing file transfer and payment flows that materially changed adoption, revenue, and loss prevention.\n\n1) Storefront White-Label E-Commerce Platform (1999/2000–present)\n\nThe Storefront platform began in 1999 as a consulting engagement, but in early 2000 Kris helped drive the evolution into a configurable, white-label e-commerce product. A pivotal early milestone came when a platform customer asked Storefront to create an online photo ordering system for the Windows XP era. In 2001, online photo ordering was a rapidly expanding market with comparatively few established competitors, and that customer request became the catalyst for Storefront’s strategic shift toward photo commerce.\n\nKris led the transformation from “generic commerce” into “photo commerce”: building systems that supported photo-specific workflows (uploading, previewing, editing, product configuration), expanded product catalogs (prints evolving into photo products and print-on-demand), and the operational realities of photo fulfillment and retail integration. Critically, this wasn’t a one-off storefront—it became a repeatable platform used by 10+ major retailers and partners, including Rite Aid, Fred Meyer, King Soopers, Smith’s, Duane Reade, Benavides, Fuji Mexico, and CVS Mexico.\n\nThe platform also enabled cross-channel behavior that mattered commercially: a significant share of revenue came from mixed journeys—customers ordering online and printing/picking up via kiosk, or starting in-store and completing on the web. That kind of “web ↔ kiosk” continuity is hard to get right because it requires consistent product rules, order state, pricing/promotions, identity/session bridging, and predictable fulfillment handoffs. Kris led the engineering decisions and sequencing that kept the system evolvable while still stable enough to run for decades.\n\n2) Windows Photo Kiosk Platform (millions of prints, $1B+ sales influence)\n\nBuilding on the photo-commerce shift, Kris helped lead the creation of Storefront’s Windows Photo Kiosk product line—the in-store consumer experience that processed millions of prints and contributed to over $1B in sales across the business (with revenue split roughly 50/50 between kiosk and web, plus a large volume of orders that started on the web and were printed at the kiosk).\n\nThese kiosks weren’t “a screen on a PC.” They were full retail systems that had to be resilient, easy for non-technical store staff to support, and operationally predictable across thousands of locations. Kris led the product and technical direction that made the kiosk a real platform: the customer UI and ordering flow, the integration points to printing/lab systems and inventory constraints, and the end-to-end transaction path that retail partners could operationalize.\n\nStorefront also iterated on the kiosk concept into adjacent products as consumer behavior shifted—like a ringtone kiosk and a music kiosk (including CD burning and iPod upload workflows). That wasn’t novelty; it demonstrated Kris’s ability to reuse core platform capabilities (catalog, pricing, UI patterns, fulfillment/entitlements, operational telemetry) while adapting the product to the constraints and customer expectations of different eras.\n\n3) Remote Management & Monitoring Platform (30,000+ devices, 12,000+ requests/min)\n\nKris led the development and expansion of a remote management platform that started as “kiosk monitoring” and evolved into a distributed control plane for an entire fleet of retail devices and connected services. At scale, this platform supported 30,000+ devices and backend throughput on the order of 12,000 requests per minute, while also being robust enough to support multi-country deployments and varied retail environments.\n\nThe impact was both operational and financial:\n\nEliminated massive field-visit costs: Early in the Rite Aid rollout, the company responsible for in-store installs reportedly made 2x what Storefront made selling kiosk software—because every update and fix required expensive hands-on service visits. Kris’s remote update capability changed that equation: software could be rolled out and patched without spending six figures on in-store visits every time something needed to change.\n\nReduced downtime with actionable telemetry: The platform didn’t just say “a kiosk is down.” It enabled Storefront to detect and act on real retail failure modes—kiosks out of paper, stuck states, device health issues—so Storefront could notify store staff to fix problems quickly and restore sales.\n\nImproved funnel performance via real usage signals: Kris used the telemetry to identify where customers abandoned the flow (which pages or steps drove drop-off), enabling targeted UX and reliability improvements that directly impacted completion rate and revenue.\n\nMade sales/accounting trustworthy in messy retail realities: In some deployments, kiosk orders were paid at the counter. The remote system enabled accurate sales figures so shrinkage (loss/theft/mismatches) could be identified and addressed—critical for retail partner trust and for maintaining the program at scale.\n\nOver time, the remote management foundation expanded beyond Windows kiosks to cover lab/print systems, experiments like digital advertising, and later device generations including Android kiosks—showing that Kris didn’t build a one-generation tool, but a durable operational platform that could adapt as hardware and retail strategies changed.\n\n4) Kiosk File Transfer + Payment System (Node.js/React) — adoption + shrinkage wins\n\nKris led the creation of a modern file transfer system designed to remove a major point of friction: customers previously had to plug phones into kiosks or bring flash drives/memory cards. The new flow let customers scan a barcode and upload photos to the kiosk without physical connection—cleaner, faster, and far more aligned with how people actually carried photos as smartphones took over.\n\nThe outcome was immediate and measurable: kiosk usage increased ~50% once customers no longer had to plug their phones in.\n\nThe project then expanded from “transfer” into “payments” using the same core infrastructure: session identification + secure handoff. Kris recognized that if you can securely connect a user’s phone session to a kiosk session, you can also use that to handle payment in a way that reduces both friction and risk. That meant:\n\nreducing the need for customers to type credit card details on a public kiosk, and\n\navoiding expensive payment hardware devices in the kiosk itself.\n\nWhen payment was introduced through this infrastructure, sales increased and shrinkage disappeared—a rare combination that retail partners love because it improves both top-line revenue and loss prevention at the same time.\n\n5) Distributed SaaS platform for customizable products (shared services across channels)\n\nAlongside the core kiosk + web business, Kris also led/owned substantial parts of a distributed SaaS platform that supported customizable products and shared capabilities across channels (web, kiosk, mobile). The through-line here is not just “built services,” but building operable services—systems designed to be monitored, debugged, rolled out safely, and incrementally modernized while keeping revenue systems running.\n\nLeadership and team impact (how he led these efforts)\n\nAcross these projects, Kris led engineering in a way that matched Storefront’s reality: a small company where priorities must be chosen carefully and every developer needs leverage. At peak, he coordinated a team of ~15 developers, averaged around 10, and delivered major outcomes even in the final year with a team of ~6. He coordinated between engineering and project managers, worked directly with key business partners to prioritize the roadmap for maximum stakeholder value, and kept delivery grounded in what would move revenue, reliability, and partner trust.\n\nHe also built strong teams by mentoring across a wide range of backgrounds—supporting senior developers while helping newer engineers ramp quickly, from boot-camp graduates with prior careers to PhD hires who were technically strong but new to business software delivery. That mentorship mattered because Storefront’s products weren’t toy apps—they were mission-critical systems running in retail, where reliability, operational clarity, and trust with partners determine whether the program grows or gets shut down."

      "name": "How has Kris worked with AI/ML technologies?",
      "context": "Kris has applied AI/ML in real production photo systems for more than a decade—well before the current LLM boom—primarily through computer vision for consumer photo workflows. At Storefront, he built and evolved imaging capabilities used across the Windows Photo Kiosk and online photo ordering platform, including automated photo enhancements (color correction pipelines), classic consumer-photo fixes (red-eye reduction), and practical image analysis features built largely on OpenCV.\n\nThat work spanned multiple platform generations:\n- Windows kiosk era: OpenCV-based imaging ran directly on Windows kiosks, and the Storefront Imaging API was initially Windows-only.\n- Modernization era (2019+): the imaging stack was moved to Linux and .NET Core (early .NET Core 1.1 timeframe), preserving core photo workflows while modernizing deployment and operations.\n- Android kiosk era: imaging capabilities were also delivered on Android as a Java service that leveraged cross-compiled OpenCV C components—adapting the same CV foundation to mobile/embedded constraints.\n\nKris’s computer-vision work focused on features that made large consumer photo libraries usable and improved downstream product generation quality. A key example was similar-image stacking: Kris implemented near-duplicate grouping so users saw clean stacks instead of long runs of essentially identical photos. The implementation combined perceptual hashing (pHash), color-histogram similarity, and capture date/time signals to robustly cluster real-world images despite minor edits, lighting shifts, or burst-mode sequences. He also implemented face detection and intelligent auto-cropping for templated products—especially auto-photobook generation—with support for multiple faces, safe margins, and aspect-ratio constraints so crops looked intentional rather than random. Kris additionally explored early OpenCV-style classification signals (e.g., coarse scene/object indicators like grass/animals) as groundwork for richer organization/search experiences, though Storefront never shipped a full search product on top of those labels.\n\nIn his final year at Storefront, Kris expanded into modern generative AI and LLM-driven product work with a pragmatic, production-minded approach:\n- Image-processing automation: he prototyped Python-based pipelines initially using PyTorch, later switching portions to Pillow when deterministic image processing was the better fit than model-driven approaches.\n- Image generation integrations: he integrated multiple image-generation APIs (including DALL·E, Stability.ai, and Flux) to explore a key customer promise—helping users produce a sellable product image without requiring Photoshop-level skills. In practice, this also enabled demo-ready experiences without requiring customers to supply source imagery; analytics showed negligible direct sales impact, but it validated UX flows and reduced demo friction.\n- LLM product-description generation: he built an early-stage system to generate improved product descriptions for Storefront’s customizable-products SaaS platform. It combined existing product descriptions with user-supplied creation metadata (title and other inputs) and LLM-derived classification of the user’s created image to produce more complete, consistent copy.\n\nTo operate these AI features responsibly and cost-effectively—especially the more expensive image generation—Kris implemented an ‘AI proxy’ layer that enforced practical safeguards. The proxy focused on abuse prevention, cost control, and safe operation (e.g., gating and filtering requests, limiting expensive calls, and ensuring the system could be monitored and throttled), rather than relying on a fully developed brand-voice or editorial workflow, since the description generator was still early-stage.\n\nKris has also experimented with model adaptation and fine-tuning techniques (e.g., LoRA and related lightweight approaches) using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers. However, he deliberately did not ship fine-tuned models to production: the available domain data was insufficient to outperform strong, low-cost foundation models, and in evaluations—particularly around the product-description generator—small/cheap hosted foundation models consistently outperformed locally-run or fine-tuned attempts.\n\nSeparately, Kris has used AI-assisted coding tools since 2021 (e.g., GitHub Copilot and newer agentic/IDE workflows like Cursor/Windsurf-style environments) as a force multiplier for prototyping and refactoring, while maintaining senior-engineering rigor around correctness, maintainability, and operational ownership."

      "name": "Can you expand on Kris's enterprise SaaS experience?",
      "context": "Kris has 25+ years building, operating, and modernizing enterprise SaaS platforms where “enterprise” means real partner integrations, strict reliability expectations, and systems that must evolve without breaking revenue. At Storefront, he helped turn an early consulting engagement (1999) into a configurable white-label platform used by major retailers and partners, including Rite Aid, Fred Meyer, King Soopers, Duane Reade, Smith’s, Benavides, Fuji Mexico, and CVS Mexico. The platform supported high-volume photo commerce across both web and in-store kiosks, with customer journeys that often crossed channels (order online, print/pick up in-store), requiring consistent catalog rules, pricing/promotions, identity/session handling, order state, and fulfillment handoffs.\n\nKris’s enterprise SaaS experience is grounded in scale and operability across a broad international footprint. The Storefront ecosystem ran in Canada, the U.S., Mexico, Sweden, Germany, Norway, the U.K., France, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium—each with its own retail constraints and operational realities. He also led a remote management and monitoring platform that started as kiosk monitoring and grew into a distributed control plane for a large device fleet (30,000+ devices; ~12,000 requests/minute). That platform reduced downtime and operating cost by enabling remote updates and configuration changes that would otherwise require expensive in-store service visits, provided actionable telemetry (device down, out-of-paper, health signals), and surfaced funnel behavior to identify where customers abandoned the flow so teams could fix the highest-impact friction points.\n\nOn the commercial side, Kris built enterprise capabilities that improved partner trust and profitability. He implemented reporting and transaction visibility that made sales figures reliable even in environments where kiosk orders were sometimes paid at the counter—enabling shrinkage to be detected and addressed. He also led work on a kiosk file-transfer and payment system that removed customer friction (no need to plug phones into kiosks), driving ~50% higher kiosk usage; when payment was handled through that secure session infrastructure, sales increased and shrinkage disappeared.\n\nMore recently, Kris co-architected and delivered a distributed SaaS platform focused on selling photo finishing products through Shopify (with an eye toward expanding to other commerce platforms over time). This included building the integration surface area required for enterprise e-commerce—product catalog sync, pricing rules, order ingestion and lifecycle, fulfillment/lab integration, and partner operational support—while also integrating Storefront’s photo editing/customization experience directly into third-party e-commerce sites so customers could personalize photo products on the partner’s platform without being bounced through a separate system. Across all of these efforts, Kris consistently balances modernization with continuity: incremental upgrades, safe releases, and operational tooling that keeps long-lived revenue systems stable while still moving forward."

    {
      "name": "What measurable outcomes came from those projects?",
      "context": "Measurable outcomes from Kris’s major projects show up in longevity, scale, revenue impact, adoption lift, and hard operational savings:\n\n25+ years of continuous production operation (platform durability): Kris helped architect and modernize a white-label e-commerce + photo commerce platform that has remained operational for over 25 years, supporting 10+ major retail partners and multiple product generations without a “stop-the-world rewrite.” The measurable outcome here is longevity under real load, plus sustained partner usage across shifting consumer and retail environments.\n\nHigh-volume photo commerce with enterprise retail reach: Across web + kiosk channels, the platform processed millions of prints per year and supported a meaningful share of large retail photo finishing programs. In particular, Rite Aid’s photo finishing peaked around ~$1B/year in sales, and Storefront’s ecosystem captured value across both web ordering and in-store kiosk printing/pickup flows—meaning revenue wasn’t isolated to one channel but enabled the combined journey.\n\nRemote Management Platform at fleet scale: Kris led the evolution of remote management from simple kiosk monitoring into a distributed control plane supporting 30,000+ devices with sustained throughput around 12,000 requests/minute. The measurable outcomes weren’t just scale, but operational leverage: remote updates/configuration reduced dependence on expensive in-store servicing and enabled proactive issue response (down devices, out-of-paper, etc.), keeping revenue systems available and reducing downtime.\n\nField-service cost avoidance (real dollars saved): Early on, the kiosk install/servicing vendor in Rite Aid reportedly earned ~2× what Storefront earned from kiosk software—because ongoing updates and fixes required in-store visits. Kris’s remote update/management capability directly reduced that burden. He’s described avoiding six-figure service costs that would otherwise recur when updates required physical visits (the concrete outcome: updates and maintenance shifted from truck-roll economics to software economics).\n\nFile transfer modernization drove adoption: Moving customers from “plug your phone into the kiosk / bring a USB stick” to barcode-based file transfer increased kiosk usage by ~50%. That’s a clear, measurable funnel improvement attributable to reducing friction at the exact point where customers used to stall.\n\nPayments modernization improved revenue integrity: Using the same secure session infrastructure to handle payment reduced friction and eliminated key retail loss modes: after payment was instituted through this flow, sales increased and shrinkage disappeared (especially in counter-payment environments). That’s a rare “up + down” metric pair: higher sales plus lower loss.\n\nHardware cost avoidance at kiosk scale: By shifting payment away from requiring specialized kiosk payment hardware, the solution avoided credit-card hardware costs across thousands of kiosks, while also improving the customer experience (less card entry on public kiosks) and lowering operational complexity."

      "name": "How has Kris used AI/ML and modern tools to improve delivery?",
      "context": "Kris has used AI/ML and modern developer tooling as leverage to improve delivery: faster iteration without lowering the bar on correctness, maintainability, or operability. Since 2021 he’s championed AI-assisted coding (GitHub Copilot plus modern agentic/IDE workflows like Cursor and Windsurf-style environments) to accelerate routine implementation, refactoring, test scaffolding, and the repetitive “glue” work that usually slows teams down—while keeping changes small, reviewable, and production-safe. He treats these tools as amplifiers rather than autopilot: generated code still gets the same senior-engineering scrutiny (edge cases, error handling, readability, architectural fit, and operational considerations). He also applies AI beyond coding assistance with hands-on experience in PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers, prompt engineering, and practical evaluation of fine-tuning approaches like LoRA-style adaptation experiments (including SIT-style experimentation), but stays pragmatic—preferring strong low-cost foundation models when data, ROI, latency, or operational complexity don’t justify fine-tuning. Related writing on his blog includes: Leveraging LLMs for Coding: Insights and Real-World Experiences https://agingcoder.com/posts/leveraging-llms-for-coding-insights-and-real-world-experiences/\n ; The Trough of Disillusionment https://agingcoder.com/posts/the-trough-of-disillusionment/\n ; LLMs and Coding 6 months later https://agingcoder.com/posts/llms-and-coding-6-months-later/\n ; Book Review: Vibe Coding https://agingcoder.com/posts/book-review-vibe-coding/ On the product and platform side, Kris also has hands-on AI/ML experience that goes beyond coding assistance. He has worked with PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers, and he has experimented with model adaptation and fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA and related lightweight approaches (including SIT-style experimentation), alongside prompt engineering and structured-output techniques. In practice, he evaluates these techniques the way a product-minded engineer should: by measuring whether they outperform strong foundation models given available domain data, latency, cost, and operational complexity. For example, in experiments around LLM-driven content generation workflows, he found that small, inexpensive hosted foundation models often beat local or fine-tuned approaches when the training data wasn’t sufficient—so he optimized for outcomes and maintainability rather than insisting on fine-tuning for its own sake.\n\nFinally, Kris has applied “modern tools” broadly—not just AI—to improve delivery: adopting better observability and diagnostics (OpenTelemetry-style instrumentation and error tracking), tightening CI/CD loops, and using automation to make systems easier to ship and operate. The consistent theme is leverage: use the newest tools where they create real advantage, keep the bar for correctness high, and build workflows that make teams faster without sacrificing reliability."
